Description of the System:

Our project, the Custom Clothing Design System, facilitates the creation of personalized fashion pieces.
Users sign up, select fabric type, design their garments using a variety of templates and customization options, and input size specifications.
They can preview their designs before confirming orders. Upon payment, the system processes designs for fabric printing/embroidery with rigorous quality control measures.
This end-to-end process ensures users receive accurately crafted garments tailored to their preferences.
Additionally, the Custom Clothing Design System caters to users' creative needs while providing convenience and flexibility.
In Plain English Our project, the Custom Clothing Design System, lets you create your own unique clothes. You choose the fabric, design your outfit, and pick your size.
After you confirm your order and pay, we make sure your design is printed or embroidered on the fabric just right. This way, you get exactly what you want, made just for you.
